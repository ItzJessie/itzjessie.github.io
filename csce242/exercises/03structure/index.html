                <h3>Who is Sonic?</h3>
                <p>Sonic Unleashed is a 2008 action-adventure game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. The game follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he attempts to stop the
                     evil Dr. Eggman, who has shattered the planet into pieces. In the process, Sonic is transformed into a new form called "Werehog," which gives him increased
                      strength but slower speed during night levels. The game features a mix of fast-paced daytime platforming and more brawler-focused nighttime segments, which
                       received a mixed reception from players. The world map is divided into various regions, each inspired by real-world locations, and Sonic must collect 
                       Chaos Emeralds to restore the planet and stop Eggmanâ€™s plot.</p>

                <h4>About Sonic</h4>
                <p>The gameplay offers a blend of traditional 2D side-scrolling levels and expansive 3D stages, with Sonic running at high speeds through elaborate environments. 
                    The daytime levels are lauded for their fluidity and fast-paced action, showcasing Sonic's iconic speed. However, the nighttime "Werehog" stages received 
                    criticism due to their slower, more combat-oriented gameplay, which diverged from the franchise's usual focus on speed. Despite this, Sonic Unleashed is 
                    often praised for its impressive visuals, vibrant environments, and the ambitious mix of gameplay styles. It's seen as a turning point for the series, 
                    introducing elements that would evolve into the later Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations.</p>
