        <h1>Welcome to Wakanda</h1>
        <p>
            Marvel Rivals brings the power and prestige of Wakanda into battle
            through two popular game modes. The first is Quickplay, a 6v6
            objective-based mode where heroes clash in fast-paced combat
            inspired by Wakanda’s advanced technology and strategic warfare. The
            second is Competitive, also a 6v6 objective-based mode, but with a
            ranking system that challenges players to rise through the ranks and
            prove themselves worthy of Wakanda’s elite. These modes can be
            highly intense, as every player’s decision can shift the tide of
            battle and determine whether Wakanda stands victorious or falls.
